better ai
    enemies respond to being attacked from behind
    enemies try to find the player when lost
    better following (more turn to face)?
better timing system
balance sucks, maybe fix that?
    with best armor, nothing can hurt you
        change armor to % reduction

    endgame, you have way too much ammunition
        reduce ammo generation
        make enemies drop ammo and reduce ammo generation even more
martini is lame full heal, should be better
    increase player health
